# AI powered Dynamic Form Creator
A dynamic form creator is a software tool or program that allows users to create forms with dynamic or interactive elements. Unlike static forms that remain unchanged once created, dynamic forms can adapt, change, or respond to user input in real-time. Here are key features and aspects associated with dynamic form creators:
1.	Interactive Elements: Dynamic form creators enable users to add interactive elements to forms, such as text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, drop-down lists, date pickers, and more. These elements can dynamically change based on user actions or predefined conditions.
2.	Conditional Logic: One of the distinguishing features of dynamic forms is the ability to incorporate conditional logic. This means that certain form fields or sections may appear or disappear based on the user's responses, making the form more flexible and tailored to individual needs.
3.	Real-time Validation: Dynamic forms often include real-time validation to ensure that the data entered by the user is accurate and meets specified criteria. This validation can occur as users type, providing instant feedback on the validity of their input.
4.	Automatic Calculations: Some dynamic form creators allow users to set up calculations within the form. This can be useful for scenarios where values entered in one field influence or determine values in other fields. For example, calculating totals based on user input.
5.	Integration with Databases or External Systems: Dynamic forms may integrate with databases or external systems to store and retrieve data. This feature is particularly useful for applications that require data persistence and management beyond the scope of the form itself.
6.	User-Friendly Interface: A good dynamic form creator typically offers a user-friendly interface that allows users to drag and drop form elements, configure settings, and preview the form in real-time. This ease of use is essential for individuals with varying technical backgrounds.
7.	Customization Options: Users can often customize the look and feel of dynamic forms, including colors, fonts, and layouts. This helps ensure that the forms align with the branding or visual preferences of the user or organization.
8.	Automated Form Generation: Some dynamic form creators can generate the underlying code or script necessary to embed the form in a website or application. This automation simplifies the process for users who may not have extensive programming knowledge.
   
Dynamic form creators find applications in various fields, including web development, data collection, surveys, registration systems, and more. They empower users to design versatile and engaging forms that adapt to specific requirements and user interactions.

# Python Program 
The provided Python script showcases the integration of the OpenAI GPT-4 language model to generate Python code in response to user input. The primary purpose of the script is to generate a Python script for a dynamic form with Tkinter and Excel integration. Below are the key components and functionalities of the program:
## OpenAI GPT-4 Integration: 
The script utilizes the OpenAI GPT-4 language model for code generation. The openai.ChatCompletion.create method is employed to interact with the GPT-4 model by providing a system message emphasizing the requirement for code-only responses and a user message containing the specified form-related input.
## User Input Construction: 
The main function collects user input related to generating Python code. The input includes information about using Tkinter for GUI, creating an Excel workbook with headers for data storage, incorporating a Save button for data entry and form field clearing, and defining the behaviour of the Exit button.
## Form Description: 
The user is prompted to describe additional properties of the form. The collected information is combined to form a comprehensive prompt for GPT-4 code generation.
## Code Generation and File Output: 
The constructed prompt is used to generate Python code using the GPT-4 model. The generated code is then saved to a raw Python file named 'dynaform-raw.py'.
## Code Filtering: 
The script defines a remove_lines function, which reads the generated Python file, removes the first three and last three lines (commonly used for GPT-4 prompt handling), and saves the cleaned code to 'dynaform.py'. This filtering ensures that only the code generated by GPT-4 is retained.

## Execution of the Generated Code: 

The final step involves importing and executing the dynamically generated Python module 'dynaform'. This allows users to interact with the generated form, saving data to an Excel workbook and terminating operations upon clicking the Exit button.
## Note: 
The actual OpenAI API key is obscured in the script for security reasons. Users should replace the placeholder '-------------------------------------------------------------' with their valid OpenAI API key. 
## Setup
To set up and run the backend:
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Create a virtual environment with python -m venv venv.
3. Activate the virtual environment.
4. Install dependencies with pip install -r requirements.txt.
